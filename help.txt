welcome to calculator v 1.0 
the operation default keys are:
	-  substraction
	+  addition
	/  division
	x  multiplication
	ans  the new answer key

edit the default keys

just open the code of this app and edit the variable in the touch description:
like mult = "*"
 
use ans 

it's the major point of this update.
So if you do a complex calculation you will have a complex answer. 
So if you want to use it after you don't want to retype it.
So just use ans 
exemple:

8/2 = 4.0
ans/2 = 2.0




for quit : exit
